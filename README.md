# AI Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent, built using Python programming language and the Pygame library. The AI opponent is designed using the A* algorithm, which is a popular technique used in game theory and decision making.

## Installation
To install the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Install the required dependencies using the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the game using the following command:


python tic_tac_toe.py
Game Play

The game is played on a 3x3 board where two players, represented by 'X' and 'O', take turns placing their symbols on the board. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the other player.

To play against the AI opponent, simply make your move by clicking on one of the empty squares on the board. The AI will then make its move, and the game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
